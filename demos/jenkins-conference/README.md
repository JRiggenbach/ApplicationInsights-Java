# Application Insights for Java

When you publish a Java web application, you want a clear view of what users are doing with it and how it’s performing. Your most effective plan for future work comes from a deep understanding of how people use what you’ve already provided: which features they like, what patterns they follow, and what they find difficult. You also want to know that your application is performing well – how quickly it responds, how performance varies under load. If performance drops or exceptions are thrown, you’d like to be notified quickly, and to diagnose the issue you’ll want powerful filter and search facilities to investigate the event traces.

[Application Insights](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) is a Microsoft service that gives you all of this, with 360° views across availability, performance & usage, and powerful drill downs to help track business objectives and prioritize investments. To use it, you add [our Java SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-java-get-started/) to your application, which sends telemetry to the Application Insights web portal. There, you slice and dice your metrics and events and configure the alerts you need.

You can send telemetry from the server, from web pages, and from various types of client applications, such as Windows Phone, iOS and Android apps.

Below are some steps to get started with Application Insights in a Java project:

## Add the Java SDK to your project

See [Get started with Application Insights in a Java web project](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-java-get-started/).

## Monitor dependencies, exceptions and execution times

See [Monitor dependencies, exceptions and execution times in Java web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-java-agent/).

## Add the Application Insights writer plugin for collectd

See [Unix performance metrics in Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-java-collectd/).

## Get user and session data

See [Usage analysis for web applications with Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-web-track-usage/).

## Capture log traces

See [Explore Java trace logs in Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-java-trace-logs/).

## Send your own telemetry                                                                                                                                                               

See [Application Insights API for custom events and metrics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics/).

## Set up web tests to make sure your application stays live and responsive                                                                                                                                                              

See [Monitor availability and responsiveness of any web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability/).

## Search events and logs to help diagnose problems                                                                                                                                                                

See [Using Diagnostic Search in Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/).
